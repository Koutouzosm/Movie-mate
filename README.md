We created an app to find friends with similar movie interestes. We used MongoDB to capture everyone's info and to make joins to match. People can make profiles and add their 5 favorite movies and if you match with at least one, that's how you make your match.
To add in the future: 
1. Make a nicer front-end
2. have a partner preference to make it more of a dating app
3. adding a huge database of movies to get more info about the movies
4. if you match with at least 3 movies then we will make your match
5. private messaging with Socket.io
6. watchlist for movies you want to watch in the future, connecting the first project to the second project
7. password reset
